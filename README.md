# Challenge-13
***Venture Funding with Deep Learning***

You work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given you a CSV containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of 
information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.

***Acceptance Criteria***

The application must meet the following acceptance criteria:

*Pre-process the data for it to be used by the neural network model.*

*Build a binary classification model using a neural network.*

*Evaluate the performance of the model.*

*Optimize the neural network model by trying several strategies.*

***Technologies***

This project is written in Python with the following libraries:

**pandas**

**tensorflow**

**sklearn**


***Contributors***

I had help with this challenge from this weeks module examples and ask BCS.
